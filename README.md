# Staff_Base_APIs

Solution of questions that was given by Staffbase were attached with this respository.

## Question 1

A customer has many systems that generate news daily (e.g., WordPress).

- What would be your suggestion to integrate it all on the Staffbase App?
- What steps do you think are required for that?

**Answer:** [Solution](/Problem_1.md)

## Question 2

Another customer wants to set up an automatic CSV import. The code is ready to run, but it
is not working. They provided you with the mapping they are using:
profile-field:firstName,profile-field:lastName,profile-field:position,eMail

- Can you point out what the issue is?
- What is the server response to a call with that mapping?
- Please describe the steps you took to solve the problem.

**Answer:** [Solution](/Problem_2.md)

## Question 3

While our CSV import feature is pretty cool and easy after setup, it doesn’t support uploading
profile pictures. To help a customer with it, create a script that utilizes our REST API:

- You need to use the key named “avatar” to achieve that.
- You may assume that all relevant images are available in one folder, and you can
  name the pictures according to your needs.
- Feel free to choose any programming or scripting language you prefer.
- Please create a Git repository (e.g., Github) and send us the link for code evaluation.
- Testing this with a few users/pictures is fine, but keep in mind that this script should
  also handle thousands of users/pictures.
